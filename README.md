### Serverless Laravel with AWS Cloud

The abstraction layer built upon AWS SAM, this project aims to simplify the onboarding process for Laravel developers venturing into the world of serverless computing. It was highly inspired by the Laravel Vapor platform. 
It endeavors to provide a self-contained AWS-oriented deployment approach, specifically designed to suit the needs of smaller projects in a cost-effective manner.

- Straightforward configuration format to set up core application infrastructure.
- Start with nearly zero costs on AWS free tier and scale to production capacity in a few simple steps.
- Provides templates for Github and Bitbucket to bootstrap your automated CI/CD pipeline.
- Build on top of existing and battle tested tools like [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html), [AWS Cloudformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) and [Bref.sh](https://bref.sh/docs/).
